 * Comments in this file will be directly parsed into the API
 * Documentation as descriptions of the associated method, message, or field.
 * These descriptions should go right above the definition of the object, and
 * can be in either block or // comment format.
 *
 * An RPC method can be matched to an lncli command by placing a line in the
 * beginning of the description in exactly the following format:
 * lncli: `methodname`
 *
 * Failure to specify the exact name of the command will cause documentation
 * generation to fail.
